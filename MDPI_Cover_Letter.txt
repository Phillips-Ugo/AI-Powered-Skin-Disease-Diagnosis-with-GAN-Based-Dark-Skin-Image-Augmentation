Dear Editor-in-Chief and Editorial Board of AI in Medicine,

I am pleased to submit our manuscript entitled "DCGAN-Based Dark Skin Image Augmentation for Improving Dermatology Classifier Fairness: An End-to-End Clinical Decision Support System" for consideration for publication in AI in Medicine.

SIGNIFICANCE AND CONTRIBUTION TO AI IN MEDICINE

This work directly addresses a critical challenge in medical AI: algorithmic bias in dermatology classification systems that disproportionately affects dark-skinned populations. Our research demonstrates how strategic data augmentation and resampling can improve both accuracy and fairness in medical image classification—core concerns for deploying AI systems in clinical settings.

Our study makes several key contributions to the field of AI in Medicine:

1. **Clinical Impact**: We achieve 85% accuracy on 7-class skin lesion classification while reducing demographic disparities (Equalized Odds difference: 0.13 → 0.07), directly addressing the clinical need for equitable diagnostic tools that work across diverse patient populations.

2. **Practical Deployment**: We deploy a complete, production-ready clinical decision support system integrating EfficientNetB0 diagnosis, Gemini-powered patient education, and geolocation-based care navigation—demonstrating end-to-end translation from research to accessible healthcare tools.

3. **Evidence-Based Guidelines**: Through systematic investigation with limited training data (40 dark-skin images), we establish minimum data requirements (>100-200 samples) for effective medical GAN augmentation, providing actionable guidance for practitioners facing similar data scarcity challenges.

4. **Fairness-Accuracy Tradeoffs**: Our findings reveal nuanced tradeoffs between overall accuracy and demographic equity, with important implications for clinical deployment decisions in diverse populations—a critical consideration for medical AI practitioners.

FIT WITH JOURNAL SCOPE

This manuscript aligns perfectly with the scope of AI in Medicine, as it:

- Addresses algorithmic bias and fairness in medical AI systems—a pressing concern as AI tools are deployed in clinical settings
- Demonstrates practical application of deep learning (EfficientNetB0) and generative models (DCGAN) for medical image analysis
- Provides a complete clinical decision support system with real-world deployment considerations
- Evaluates performance using rigorous statistical methods and fairness metrics relevant to medical AI
- Addresses data availability and reproducibility concerns through open-source codebase and public dataset usage

Our work builds on established foundations in medical AI (e.g., dermatologist-level classification by Esteva et al., 2017) while addressing critical gaps in fairness and demographic representation that have been highlighted by recent research (Daneshjou et al., 2022; Kinyanjui et al., 2020).

CONTEXT WITHIN EXISTING LITERATURE

While prior work has demonstrated high accuracy in dermatology AI, our study is among the first to systematically investigate fairness interventions with limited training data. We bridge gaps between:
- Research on bias in medical AI (Obermeyer et al., 2019; Daneshjou et al., 2022) and practical mitigation strategies
- GAN-based augmentation for medical imaging (Frid-Adar et al., 2018) and minimum data requirements for effectiveness
- High-performance classifiers (Tschandl et al., 2018; Kassem et al., 2020) and deployment-ready clinical decision support systems

Our findings provide evidence-based guidance that will benefit the medical AI community facing similar challenges with underrepresented populations and limited training data.
