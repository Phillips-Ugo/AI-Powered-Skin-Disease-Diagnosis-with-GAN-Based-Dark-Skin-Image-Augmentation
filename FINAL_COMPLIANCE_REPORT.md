## ⚠️ **VERIFICATION NEEDED (Before Submission)**

### 1. **Abstract Word Count** ⚠️
**Action Required**: 
- Count exact words in abstract (line 46)
- MDPI typically allows 200 words maximum
- Current estimate: ~200 words (borderline)
- **Recommendation**: Verify exact count and trim if necessary

### 2. **Figure Files** ⚠️
**Action Required**:
- Verify all 7 PNG files are in your Overleaf project:
  - `class_distribution.png`
  - `gan_architecture.png` (used for both system and DCGAN architecture)
  - `training_curves.png`
  - `baseline_confusion_matrix.png`
  - `gan_confusion_matrix.png`
  - `performance_comparison.png`
  - `app_screenshots.png`
- **Note**: `gan_architecture.png` is used twice (for `fig:architecture` and `fig:gan`). This is fine if it's a combined figure, but verify it shows both system architecture and DCGAN details.

### 3. **Figure Quality** ⚠️
**Action Required**:
- Verify all figures are **300 DPI minimum**
- Ensure text in figures is readable
- Check that figures are not pixelated
- **MDPI Requirement**: "Unclear language or figures may risk delays and even rejection"

### 4. **Language Quality** ⚠️
**Action Required**:
- Have a native English speaker review for clarity
- Check for typos and grammatical errors
- Ensure technical terms are used consistently
- **MDPI Requirement**: "Authors are responsible for ensuring good English"

### 5. **GitHub Repository** ⚠️
**Action Required**:
- Verify GitHub link works: `https://github.com/Phillips-Ugo/Medical-Image-Diagnosis`
- Ensure repository is public
- Verify all code/data mentioned is accessible
