      <abstract>
        <p>Despite achieving dermatologist-level accuracy, deep learning models for skin lesion classification exhibit persistent performance disparities across skin tones, with dark-skinned individuals (Fitzpatrick IV--VI) experiencing significantly lower diagnostic accuracy due to severe underrepresentation in training datasets like HAM10000 (&lt;5% dark-skin samples). We present a comprehensive approach to fair skin lesion classification that achieves 85% accuracy through strategic class resampling and demonstrates improved demographic equity. Our EfficientNetB0 classifier, trained on HAM10000's 7-class dataset with resampling to 5,000 samples per class, achieves strong baseline performance (85% accuracy, 0.85 macro-F1) while addressing severe class imbalance (58:1 ratio). Through systematic evaluation including fairness metrics, we show that our approach reduces performance disparities: GAN-augmented models improve fairness (Equalized Odds difference: 0.13 → 0.07) by enhancing dark-skin performance, though with a tradeoff in overall accuracy. We investigate DCGAN-based synthetic augmentation with 40 identified dark-skin training images, generating 3,500 synthetic samples (500 per disease class), and establish minimum data requirements for effective medical image synthesis. Our findings demonstrate that strategic resampling provides a robust foundation for fair dermatology AI, while synthetic augmentation requires careful validation. We deploy our complete pipeline as an integrated clinical decision support system with Gemini-powered patient education and geolocation-based care navigation, demonstrating practical translation from research to accessible healthcare tools.</p>
