# Cover Letter Guide for MDPI Submission

## Cover Letter Requirements

Your cover letter must include:

1. ✅ **Significance**: Explain why the content is significant
2. ✅ **Context**: Place findings in context of existing work
3. ✅ **Scope Fit**: Explain why manuscript fits journal scope
4. ✅ **Required Statements**: Include mandatory statements (see below)
5. ✅ **AI in Medicine Link**: Specifically explain connection to AI in Medicine

## Required Statements

You MUST include these two statements:

1. "We confirm that neither the manuscript nor any parts of its content are currently under consideration for publication with or published in another journal."
2. "All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to AI in Medicine."

## What I've Created

I've created `MDPI_Cover_Letter.txt` with a complete cover letter that:

- ✅ Explains significance (clinical impact, fairness, practical deployment)
- ✅ Places work in context (builds on prior research, addresses gaps)
- ✅ Demonstrates fit with journal scope (medical AI, fairness, CDSS)
- ✅ Includes all required statements
- ✅ Specifically explains connection to AI in Medicine

## How to Use

1. **Copy the cover letter** from `MDPI_Cover_Letter.txt`
2. **Paste into MDPI submission system** in the "Cover Letter" section

4. **Submit**

## Key Highlights in the Cover Letter

- **Clinical Impact**: 85% accuracy with improved fairness
- **Practical Deployment**: Complete CDSS system
- **Evidence-Based**: Minimum data requirements established
- **Fairness Focus**: Addresses algorithmic bias in medical AI
- **Reproducibility**: Open-source codebase

The cover letter is professional, concise, and highlights why your work is important for the AI in Medicine community.
