## 🎯 **Before vs After Examples**

### **Example 1: Introduction**
**Before:**
"Deep learning has significantly advanced computer-assisted dermatology, enabling fast, scalable, and increasingly accurate diagnosis of skin lesions. Modern convolutional neural networks can match or exceed dermatologist-level performance on standardized datasets, promising democratized access to expert-level skin cancer screening."

**After:**
"Deep learning models for dermatology diagnosis achieve dermatologist-level accuracy on standardized datasets, yet consistently underperform on dark-skinned individuals."

**Improvement:** 2 sentences → 1 sentence, more direct, same information

---

### **Example 2: Contributions**
**Before:**
"High-performance fair classifier: We achieve 85% accuracy (0.85 macro-F1) on HAM10000's 7-class skin lesion classification through strategic class resampling, demonstrating that traditional techniques effectively address both class imbalance and provide a strong foundation for fair dermatology AI."

**After:**
"High-performance fair classifier: 85% accuracy (0.85 macro-F1) on HAM10000's 7-class classification through strategic resampling, demonstrating effective class imbalance mitigation."

**Improvement:** Removed redundant phrases, more direct

---

### **Example 3: Related Work**
**Before:**
"Multiple strategies exist for mitigating dataset bias:

**Data Collection**: The most direct approach is collecting more diverse data. The ISIC Archive represents ongoing efforts, though progress remains slow due to logistical and privacy constraints.

**Resampling**: Chawla et al. introduced SMOTE for synthetic minority oversampling in tabular data. For images, simple oversampling with augmentation remains common..."

**After:**
"Strategies for mitigating bias include: (1) **Data collection**---direct but slow due to logistical constraints; (2) **Resampling**---SMOTE for tabular data, oversampling with augmentation for images..."

**Improvement:** 4 paragraphs → 1 concise list, same information
